Context:
This exercise involves developing the initial components of a movie search engine using the Vuetify app. Users should be able to search for movies and mark them as favorites. The UI should include a search input, a results table, and a user-friendly method for marking movies as favorites. Favorite movies should be stored locally, and real data should be fetched from OMDb API using the provided API key (59c517d1), with a constraint of not making API calls more frequently than once every 200ms.

Your Task:
Your task comprises three parts:

Conduct a code review for the code in Implementation.vue. Provide comments in the file as if reviewing code written by a junior developer. Explain any issues and suggest better solutions.

Develop your version of the movie search engine app accessible via "/implementation2" that fulfills all the requirements mentioned in the "context" section. Prioritize good code structure, maintainability, and functionality over fancy design. Feel free to incorporate useful libraries.

Implement the task described in the Laravel project located in the "laravel-project" folder. Refer to the project's readme file for further details.

Details:

For Part 1: Provide code review comments directly in the Implementation.vue file, treating it as if it were written by a junior developer.
For Part 2: Emphasize code quality, structure, and maintainability. Prioritize functionality over design and consider the project's potential for future extensions.
For Part 3: Locate the Laravel project in the "laravel-project" folder and refer to the project's readme file for specific instructions.
Time Allocation:
Allocate 1-2 hours for completing all three parts of the task. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
